description: Alias for `/devagent:wbs update` (workflow step 17)
allowed-tools: Bash
---

Run `scripts/wbs.sh update "$@"` with the user's arguments.

This is the workflow step-17 entrypoint. Identical behavior to
`/devagent:wbs update`; exists as a separate command so the 21-step
workflow chaining (`--auto`, `--through`) and skill mapping can
reference a single verb.

## Completion handoff

After marking the step `[x]` (or `[-]` if skipped) and logging:

**STOP.** Do not invoke any other `/devagent:*` command on your own.
End your final message with this exact question (substituting the
correct next-step slash command from the checklist):

> Would you like to continue on to /devagent:<next-step-name>?

The next-step name is the first line in the issue's checklist.md
that starts with `- [ ]` -- read that, take the verb after the
step number, and substitute it into the question.

The only exception: if you were invoked under a `/devagent:next
--auto` or `--through` chain (recognizable because the preceding
turn's tool output contained a `CHAIN: /devagent:next ...` line),
then do NOT ask the question -- instead invoke that exact CHAIN:
command verbatim to continue the chain.

If the operator typed a one-off `/devagent:<name>` directly (no
preceding CHAIN: line), DO ask the question and wait for the
operator's answer. Do not advance even if your internal TODO list
still has steps after this one -- the operator's last explicit
instruction is the authoritative scope.
