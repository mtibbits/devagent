# /devagent:document

Step 9 of the 21-step devAgent workflow. Invokes the
`core-document-actual-work` skill to write
`<issue-dir>/actualWork.md`.

## Argument parsing

Per `commands/draft.md`.

## Workflow

1. Resolve `project`, `issue-dir`, `$NOTE`.
2. Verify state file has a `baseline_sha` (needed to diff actual
   against plan). If absent, halt — operator must run branch first.
3. Invoke `core-document-actual-work` with `$ISSUE_DIR` and
   `$NOTE`.
4. The skill writes actualWork.md and calls `scripts/checklist-log.sh`.

## Halt and ask if

- State file lacks `baseline_sha`.
- imPlan.md lacks `## Definition of done` section.

## Skipping policy

Never auto-skip; documenting deviations is the entire value of this
step.

## Completion handoff

After the skill completes:

- Mark the step `[x]` (or `[-]` skipped) and log via
  `scripts/checklist-log.sh`.
- **STOP.** Do not invoke any other `/devagent:*` command unless this
  invocation arrived under a `/devagent:next --auto` or `--through`
  chain — recognizable because the preceding turn's output contained a
  `CHAIN: /devagent:next ...` line. In that case, invoke that
  CHAIN: command verbatim to continue.
- If the operator typed `/devagent:<name>` directly (no CHAIN: line),
  do NOT advance. The operator's last explicit instruction is the
  authoritative scope. Wait for the next operator turn even if your
  internal todo list still has follow-on steps queued.
