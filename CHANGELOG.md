# Changelog

All notable changes to devAgent are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

devAgent is currently versioned by its **git commit SHA** (the marketplace entry
carries no pinned `version`), so every commit on `master` is a release and
`claude plugin update` tracks new commits without a reinstall. When a stable
release cadence is adopted (a go-public decision — see #532, ratified
2026-07-20: SHA-tracking stays until then), tagged versions (`claude plugin
tag`) will get their own dated sections below.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed — 2026-07-25 (#541)
- superpowers demoted from declared dependency to recommended plugin: the
  manifest carries no `dependencies` key (measured at CC 2.1.211: dependencies
  never auto-install and an unresolved one silently disables the whole plugin);
  draft / implement / review gain built-in fallbacks + a one-line install
  nudge, and `/devagent:doctor` WARNs when the plugin is absent or disabled.

Current capabilities as of this commit:

### Core
- **57 slash commands** driving a fixed **22-step issue workflow** (plus the optional
  research step 22 and spike step 23), with all
  state preserved on disk so you can switch issues — or hand one to a fresh
  session — without losing context.
- `next`/`capture`/`ship` converted from commands to user-invocable skills with
  `references/`; `next` thinned 5,764 → 2,209 chars whole-file (operative body
  5,565 → 1,916, pinned under 2,000 by #439's size canary).
- Backends: **GitHub, GitLab, and JIRA** (issue trackers + code forges).
- Subsystems: capture + issue red-team, revision, WBS, status reports, and an
  auth subsystem (PAT / SSH-key lifecycle).

### Plugin conformance & distribution readiness
- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` manifest declaring the `superpowers` dependency.
- SHA-versioned marketplace entry (no pinned `version`) so `/plugin update`
  works without uninstall + reinstall.
- Every command routes its scripts through `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` (works from a
  marketplace install), enforced by a CI canary.
- `allowed-tools` scoped past a blanket `Bash` grant, on commands and skills
  alike.
- Invocation control: the 14 internal `core-*` skills are hidden from the `/`
  menu (`user-invocable: false`), and `auth`/`init`/`use` are operator-timed
  (`disable-model-invocation: true`).
- `argument-hint` autocomplete grammar on every command.
- Packaging: LICENSE (MIT), this CHANGELOG, and a README install section.
